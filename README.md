# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.

This project consists of two parts:

## Task 1: Set up Project
You will need to follow the Lambda School Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [ ] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [ ] Add your TL as a collaborator
- [ ] Clone this repo
- [ ] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
  - [ ] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This should contain the link to your completed codepen from part 2 as well as the review questions/answers
  - [ ] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> main).
  - [ ] Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
- [ ] TL then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into main "STUDENT FORK".

## Task 2: MVP
1. fork this codepen https://codepen.io/BritHemming/pen/eYYEoPa?editors=1100
2. You will be marking up all of the HTML and styling it to look like this: https://codepen.io/BritHemming/full/jONmxOm using CSS
* this should be review from yesterday/ extra practice
3. After you are finished please copy the review questions into your .txt file and answer them
4. don't forget to add, commit and push your changes.


## Task 3: Stretch
Stretch Review questions: 
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
Stretch Git Tasks
- [ ] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [X] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
      A: A merge conflict happens when the same line of code is modified by multple devs. To resolve it from what I understand it is required to create an additional branch to save changes, then merge with the master branch post review to ensure that the better, or best code is added to the branch. 

  - [X] Research the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the main branch.
    A: git pull - immediately download all changes to the main repo. Rebase - According the freecodecamp it is the method to compress all changes into a single patch. merge- merges all changes from a branch into the master. 
  - [X] Research the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.
    A: git reset - undos local changes to a git repo. Revert - makes a new commit. safer alternative to reset when it comes to losing work. clean - removes any files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory. 

- [X] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 
  A: Downloaded and set up Github Desktop (made sense to use the client for the Version Control that we were already using).

- [X] Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
A: Used the instructions from: https://inchoo.net/dev-talk/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-for-git-authorization/
A1: Can confirm via image that this was completed.
